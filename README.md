# MLB Scorigami

This is a repository storing my work for generating my version of Scorigami for the MLB. The interactive plot can be found at rpubs.com/chadallison/mlb_scorigami. Feel free to check it out and let me know if you have any suggestions. You can reach me via email at chadrallison@outlook.com. Thanks!
